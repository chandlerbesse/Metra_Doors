# Metra Door Predictor
As a student who uses the Metra for commuting to/from school, I have noticed that the train doors at Ogilvie (OTC) do not open
on a set schedule. Waiting to enter the train can become very irritating when some days the doors open 30 minutes before departure
and only 5 minutes beforehand on others. It is seemingly random, so I decided to start tracking when the doors open along with the
departure time to train. Using the data collected thus far, I have trained a linear regression model to predict when the train 
doors will open. At this point in time, I do not have a lot of data, but I will continue updating the dataset over the coming semesters.
For now, linear regression is serving its purpose, but as the dataset grows, I will be interested to see what other models might 
be better suited for the problem!
